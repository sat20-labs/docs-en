Roadmap
============

SAT20 is just the beginning of our efforts to build the BTC ecosystem. Throughout this development process, we adhere to the following principles, which we believe reflect future trends:
1. Asset Issuance on the BTC Mainnet: There will be an increasing number of assets issued on the BTC mainnet.
2. Asset Trading on Layer 2 Networks: Infinite liquidity while ensuring assets remain under users' control, offering security, cost-effectiveness, and speed.
3. The BTC network will become the foundation of the digital world, leading to a "one sat, one world" future.

SAT20 Asset Issuance Protocol (ORDX Protocol)
----
The development of the asset issuance protocol will be completed in the first half of 2024.

SAT20 Asset Circulation Protocol (Satoshi Transcending Protocol)
----
A protocol that allows BTC (Satoshi) to circulate freely.  
We hope to complete the prototype development of the Transcend Protocol in 2025Q1 and run it on SatoshiNet.  

Native Extension Network: SatoshiNet
----
SatoshiNet is a modified BTC network based on BTCD source code. It is the first native extension network of the BTC mainnet based on the Satoshi Transcending Protocol (STP). Any technology that benefits BTC development can be experimented with on this network.
SatoshiNet is expected to officially launch in Q2 2025.

Satoshi Swap Market: SatSwap Market
----
SatSwap Market is a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the SatoshiNet, developed and operated by ordx.market, providing asset trading services for the SatoshiNet.
ordx.market is a professional platform in the BTC ecosystem that offers complete services for asset minting, browsing, trading, and management. It supports all major assets in the BTC ecosystem, as well as both Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. In the future, it will connect more ecosystems and public chains with SatoshiNet as the central hub.
SatSwap Market is expected to launch alongside SatoshiNet in Q2 2025.

Open Source
----
To ensure efficient early-stage development, we will initially keep the project closed source. However, we plan to gradually open and eventually fully open-source the entire SAT20 project. Through community management, SAT20 will evolve into a fully decentralized project that can incorporate any BTC-native technologies, such as BTC native smart contracts or any future BTC-native layer 2 networks. We aim to promote mass adoption of SAT20 within the BTC ecosystem through open-source, permissionless collaboration and contribute to the prosperity of the BTC ecosystem. We welcome teams interested in SAT20 to join us in building a world of satoshis.

Plan:
1. Provide installation packages to assist collaborating teams in setting up their own service nodes (starting from June 2024).
2. Gradually open-source the project, releasing one module at a time as they mature (beginning in Q4 2024):
    * Indexer
    * Name service
    * SatoshiNet
    * STP
3. Explore community management models and continue the development of SAT20 (promoting community governance after open-sourcing, making Pearl the governance token for proposals, voting, etc.).
