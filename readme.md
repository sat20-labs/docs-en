SAT20 Protocol
=========

SAT20 is a "Satoshi Standard" protocol for issuing and circulating BTC native assets, with its core feature being the binding of assets to satoshis and their free movement alongside satoshis.
SatoshiNet is the native extension network of the BTC mainnet, based on Lightning channels and parallel BTC networks. Its purpose is to expand the liquidity of BTC's native assets. SatoshiNet is the implementation of the SAT20 protocol.

SatoshiNet
---
SatoshiNet is the native extension network of the BTC mainnet, built on Lightning channels and parallel BTC networks, providing a secure, fast, and cost-effective native circulation environment for BTC and the mainnet's native assets. SatoshiNet is an implementation example of the SAT20 protocol, constructed based on it.

Key Features of SatoshiNet:
1. **Native second-layer** extension network for BTC
2. **No bridge**: based on Lightning channels
3. **No new tokens**: all assets come from the BTC mainnet
4. **Same consensus**: same addresses, same network fees, same assets
5. Fast block times, low fees
6. Supports smart contracts


Asset Circulation Protocol (STP)
----
The SAT20 Asset Circulation Protocol, also known as the Satoshi Transcending Protocol (STP), is a protocol based on Lightning Network channels that defines the rules for the circulation of Satoshi assets.

Features of the Satoshi Transcending Protocol:
1. **BTC Native**: Inherits the Lightning Channel RSMC protocol, with asset security ensured by the BTC mainnet, giving users full control.
2. **Full Asset Support**: Supports native asset protocols on the BTC mainnet, such as Ordinals, Runes, BRC20, ORDX, and more.
3. **Dynamic Lightning Channel Technology**
4. **Simple Atomic Interface**:
    * Open and close channels
    * Lock and unlock assets
    * Splicing
    * Satoshi Swap
5. **Compatibility with Other Public Chains**


Asset Issuance Protocol (ORDX)
----
The SAT20 asset issuance protocol is an enhanced version of the Ordinals protocol. It is used to issue assets called SAT20 assets. These assets are bound to satoshis and inherit the properties of satoshis:
1. Satoshis are not destructible, so the assets are also non-destructible.
2. The data bound to satoshis is immutable, so once the assets are issued, they cannot be modified.
3. Wherever the satoshis are, the assets are also present, allowing assets to freely move across different networks alongside satoshis.
4. Assets belong to the owner of the satoshis, so when satoshis are transferred, the assets are transferred as well.
5. The non-fungible nature of satoshis determines the non-fungibility of assets, making them inherently SFT (Semi-Fungible Token) assets.
6. Satoshis can be bound to any data, including smart contracts, enabling assets to have a certain level of intelligence.
