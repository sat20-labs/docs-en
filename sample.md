Sample layer 2 network of SAT20: TVN
====

SAT20 is an open source protocol compatible with all BTC native second layers. Anyone can use it independently without permission or payment. We have provided satoshinet as a sample of the second layer network, and we need an application to unleash the power of the second layer satoshinet.

To demonstrate the unlimited potential of SAT20 and promote its applications, we plan to develop a Dapp that gradually realizes our vision of "one sat, one universe."   
TVN is a dapp in the envisioned BTC ecosystem, and can also be considered a third-layer network based on BTC's mainnet and satoshinet. It is decentralized, permissionless, and audit-resistant, and anyone can access and use it. The TVN network features the following capabilities:

Self-Custodied Web3 Accounts
----
Everyone can create a web3 account directly and free of charge. The TVN network incorporates a comprehensive self-custody system for web3 accounts, empowering users to manage their accounts independently.

SAT20-based Name Service
----
Immutable and permissionless names that cannot be tampered with or blocked. Users can bind their accounts with names they mint or acquire from other sources, creating their own Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).

SAT20-based Key Sharding Storage Service
----
Private keys are split into multiple shards and distributed across multiple satoshis, eliminating concerns about losing or compromising mnemonic phrases.

Super Accounts
----
Accounts on the TVN network are super accounts capable of connecting numerous sub-accounts and bridging across multiple blockchains.

P2P Messaging System
----
An encrypted end-to-end messaging system is built into the network, allowing users to create public channels as well.

Integrated SAT20 DEX
----
The TVN network integrates with a SAT20 decentralized exchange (DEX), enabling users to participate in digital asset trading while maintaining full control of their funds.

Hierarchical Data Storage
----
Users can encrypt and store their data using their own keys, with different levels of importance distributed across various networks. The most critical assets and data are stored on the BTC network, ensuring they are never lost, albeit at a higher cost. Less critical data can be stored on IPFS for affordability, although with reduced security. Small-scale data can be directly stored on the TVN network's DKVS (Distributed Key-Value Store) system, providing intermediate pricing and convenience.

Paid Sharing of Innovative Content
----
Combining SVM (Satoshi Virtual Machine), micro-payments, and paid encrypted content.

Paid Usage of Software Modules
----
SVM, micro-payments, and paid APIs.

Conclusion
----
There is much more to explore and build within the TVN network, as we strive to create our own fully digital worldâ€”a universe of satoshis. Let us join together to shape and explore the additional features of the TVN network, ultimately realizing our vision of a digital world that belongs entirely to us.
