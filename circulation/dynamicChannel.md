Dynamic Channel Technology
====

Traditional Lightning Network channels consist of a single UTXO, while the Lightning channels in the Satoshi Transcending Protocol (STP) are composed of a set of UTXOs. These UTXOs can be dynamically added or removed using splicing technology, or the capacity of a specific UTXO can be adjusted. It is even possible to manage an entire Lightning channel using a multi-signature address. This flexibility is essential for transferring assets from the main network to the second-layer network.

1. Multiple UTXOs  
2. Arbitrary addition or removal of UTXOs  
3. Arbitrary adjustment of UTXO size
