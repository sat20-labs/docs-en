### RSMC

In the Lightning Network, RSMC (Revocable Sequence Maturity Contract) is a contract type used to ensure the security and reliability of Lightning Network channels.  
RSMC is a time-locked contract that allows participants to revoke or close a Lightning Network channel under specific conditions. Its design aims to prevent fraudulent activities and malicious actions, ensuring the security of transactions.  

Assets are locked within the channel, and users hold commitment transactions while having the ability to construct penalty transactions to secure their assets. At any time, users can reclaim their funds without needing permission from any third party.
