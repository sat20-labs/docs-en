Enhanced UTXO Model
====

In the layer-1 network, UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) only consist of the quantity of satoshis and do not include specific ordinal numbers for each satoshi. However, when satoshis are mapped to the layer-2 network, their attributes are fully reflected in the UTXOs, greatly enhancing the capabilities of the UTXO model.

In the enhanced UTXO (enUTXO), each UTXO will include both the quantity of satoshis and their corresponding ordinal numbers. This greatly facilitates the transfer of satoshis and the verification of assets associated with each satoshi. In addition to preventing double spending, enUTXO allows for a clear understanding of the transaction history of each satoshi.
