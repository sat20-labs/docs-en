The Satoshi Transcending Protocol (STP) supports the native asset issuance protocols on the main Bitcoin network, including Ordinals, ORDX, Runes, BRC20, and others. In fact, as long as the asset issuance protocol is based on the UTXO model, it can be supported by the STP and traded on the SatoshiNet.
