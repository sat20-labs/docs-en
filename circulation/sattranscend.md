Satoshi Transcending
====

With the support of the SAT20 protocol, the Satoshi locked in the lightning channel will automatically ascending to the second-layer network and enter the user's wallet with the same address on the second-layer network. The user controls the circulation in the second-layer network. 
At any time, the user can decide to descend the Satoshi he owns from the second-layer network to the first-layer network 

The user transfers the Satoshi through the wallet transaction on the second-layer network. Each signature will synchronously update the status of the lightning channel to ensure that the user can evacuate safely at any time.
