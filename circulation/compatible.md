The Satoshi Transcending Protocol (STP) is an independent protocol that enables assets on the BTC mainnet—whether BTC, Ordinals, Runes, BRC20, ORDX, or others—to traverse to another network under the complete control of the user. As long as the network supports the atomic interface of STP (public chains that are UTXO-based natively support it, and public chains with smart contracts and support for asset issuance and destruction also support it).

The ability of STP comes from the RSMC protocol of Lightning channels. If we consider the BTC mainnet as a reservoir and other public chains, like ETH, as another reservoir, the role of STP is to connect these two reservoirs with a pipe (via the Lightning channel) and control the flow of assets into and out of this pipe. This entire process can be fully controlled by the user.
