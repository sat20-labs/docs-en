Satoshi Swapping
====

Satoshi can be swapped between different UTXOs, which is the core of Satoshi's super liquidity on the second-layer network.

Satoshi locking, transcending, and swapping are the core technologies that enable secure movement of satoshi assets from layer-1 to layer-2 and facilitate their free circulation within the BTC native layer-2 network. This technology ensures the security of user funds while allowing satoshis and their associated assets to freely flow within the network.
