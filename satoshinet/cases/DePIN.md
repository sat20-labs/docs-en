DePIN Network Composed of Old Smartphones
====

Many old smartphones from 7-8 years ago are equipped with quad-core CPUs, over 2GB of RAM, and at least 16GB of storage. These phones are capable of functioning as lightweight nodes, providing some computation and storage services. Additionally, these old phones consume very little power. If a large number of such devices are connected together, they could form a network with significant economies of scale.

Interestingly, SAT20 assets are solely tied to Satoshis, and while the quantity of Satoshis may be large, the storage and computation required to manage them are actually quite small. If each household uses an old smartphone as a lightweight node, it could form a decentralized indexing service network. This network would not only verify individual assets but also maintain the security of the entire network, provide storage and computational services, and distribute network data in a decentralized manner. Additionally, the network could perform tasks such as SVM execution, earning service fees in the process.
