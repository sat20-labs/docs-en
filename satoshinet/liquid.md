Liquidity Pool
====

The liquidity pool is a key module for keeping operational costs low on SatoshiNet. It reduces the likelihood of fees skyrocketing due to the dynamic adjustments of channels. The SatoshiNet Foundation is responsible for building a public liquidity pool that provides the basic liquidity needed for the network.

Additionally, the liquidity pool can also be operated by third parties.
