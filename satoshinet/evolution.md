Continuous Evolution
---  

SatoshiNet is a continuously evolving system. From the very first day of its inception, it has been a product of constant evolution. It represents the evolution of the Lightning Channel protocol in a new direction, distinct from the traditional Lightning Network. SatoshiNet also embodies the continuous progression of mainnet technologies, providing a platform for the realization and development of various ideas and technologies that have historically led to BTC network forks, such as larger blocks, additional OP codes, faster block processing speeds, and more.  

SatoshiNet can improve block production speed. Once a block is filled, it can be immediately packaged without delay. This allows block production to reach the maximum capacity of network throughput and the limits of local computation and verification. With the support of modern computer hardware, transmitting and verifying 4MB of data per second is a straightforward task. From this perspective, the network could easily handle 10,000 transactions per second or even more.  

SatoshiNet can also plan for block size expansion if needed. As long as the network and hardware can keep up, blocks of 16MB or even larger are feasible.  

SatoshiNet has the potential to activate various OP codes to enable Turing-complete smart contracts. This capability would pave the way for developing a native Layer 3 network or establishing connections to other blockchains. As a result, SatoshiNet would become a mediator network connecting the BTC mainnet to external networks, enabling BTC to flow freely across all ecosystems and unleashing the full potential of BTC and native mainnet assets.  

The possibilities for innovation on SatoshiNet extend even further, particularly in applications and services built on the network.  
For example, SatoshiNet naturally supports BTC mainnet-based DID (Decentralized Identity). If it also adds a DA service, it could unlock limitless potential for imagination, allowing everyone to innovate and create in ways yet to be explored.
