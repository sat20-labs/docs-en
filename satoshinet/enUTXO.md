Enhanced UTXO Model
====

In the Layer 1 network, a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) only represents the amount of satoshis (sats) without including additional data. However, when sats traverse to the second-layer network, their properties are fully encapsulated within the UTXO, significantly enhancing its capabilities.

The **enUTXO** will contain both the amount of sats and the asset information, greatly facilitating the circulation of sats and the validation of assets on the SatoshiNet. This not only prevents double-spending but also enables the possibility of supporting any asset type on SatoshiNet. Additionally, it allows for a clear and intuitive view of an asset's transaction history, improving transparency and traceability within the ecosystem.
