Security of SatoshiNet
---

The security of SatoshiNet is ensured through the following mechanisms:

1. **Lightning channels based on RSMC contracts**: These are native extensions of the BTC mainnet and share the security of the BTC mainnet. This is the most fundamental aspect of security.
  
2. **SatoshiNet based on BTCD source code**: The security at the technical level is provided by BTC technology, ensuring the prevention of double-spending of assets.

3. **Assets and sats all from mainnet**: Every satoshi and asset on SatoshiNet originates from the BTC mainnet, providing asset-level security and preventing the creation or destruction of assets.

4. **Proof of Stake (POS) mechanism on SatoshiNet**: Economically ensures that there is no incentive for malicious behavior among SatoshiNet nodes.

Ultimately, SatoshiNet combines these factors to ensure a robust and rock-solid security model. This security is based on the technology and consensus of the BTC mainnet. As long as the BTC mainnet's technology and consensus remain intact, every satoshi on SatoshiNet remains under the control of the user, and no one can take them away.
