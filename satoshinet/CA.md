Smart Contracts
====

SatoshiNet supports two types of smart contracts:  
1. **Template Contracts**: Directly embedded in the SatoshiNet source code through OP instructions to hard-code a contract.
2. **Turing-complete On-chain Smart Contracts**: Activated via the OP_CAT instruction, enabling Turing-complete on-chain smart contracts.
